First question:
Samantha is an avid collector of lucky numbers. She believesthat each number has its own unique energy and can bringgood luck if used correctly. One day, she came across a newnumber that had a mysterious aura and she could not resistfinding out more about it. She heard that the number mayfall within the digit combinations, so she decided to sum upall the four-digit even numbers and then keep adding thedigits of the summation until a single digit is found to unlockits secrets. Later, she must check again whether the singledigit is odd or even. If odd, then you must say “Odd Found”otherwise you must return “Even found”. Write a C programto help her in finding the mysterious number.
Answer:
while (sum > 0) {
digit += sum % 10;
sum /= 10;
}
sum = digit;
}
if (sum % 2 == 1) {
printf("Odd Found\n");
odd_found = 1;
} else {
printf("Even Found\n");
}
return odd_found;
}
