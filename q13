First question:
The temperature in Chennai exists somewhere between 280Cto 330C in a particular week. The temperature in Delhi is 8 0Clesser than in Chennai. Likewise, the temperature in Haveri is5 0C more than that of Chennai. Write a C program to findthe temperature of Gangtok for a particular week, which isthe temperature difference between Delhi and Haveri. Getthe temperature of Chennai ( 0C) as input for the week of 7days and the temperature of Gangtok ( 0C) as output for theweek of 7 days. Implement the program using arrays andvalidate the rules.
Answer:
printf("Invalid temperature for Chennai. Temperature should be between 28C and33C.\n");
return 1;
}
}
for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
delhi[i] = chennai[i] - 8;
haveri[i] = chennai[i] + 5;
}
for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
gangtok[i] = haveri[i] - delhi[i];
}
printf("\nTemperature of Gangtok for theweek:\n");for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
printf("%dC "
, gangtok[i]);
}
printf("\n");
return 0;
}
